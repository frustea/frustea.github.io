# About Me

*I am a Physics Ph.D. student at the Joint Quantum Institute and QuICS, at the University of Maryland.
*My research advisors during my studies were Mohammad Hafezi, Michael Gullans, and Jacob Taylor.
*My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and physics, particularly in quantum learning theory, quantum-enhanced machine learning, applications of classical machine learning in many-body physics, and analog quantum simulation.
*In the past, I have worked on:
    *Quantum learning theory.
    *QML algorithms for NISQ devices.
    *Analog quantum computing with silicon.
    *Quantum dot design using machine learning.
    *Quantum gravity and AdS/CFT correspondence.
    *Experimental particle physics.
    *Superconducting qubits.
